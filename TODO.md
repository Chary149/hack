# TODO: Resolve Force Loading Benign Data, Fix False Positives, Popup Issues, Add Reporting and Safe Marking

## Completed Changes
- Modified `loadBenignData()` in `background.js` to check cache first before loading fallback data
- Added caching of benign data after loading from `benign.json`
- Updated `isBenign()` to check known benign data before calling Google Safe Browsing API
- Changed console logs to remove "Force loading" and "No API endpoint configured" messages
- Added error handling for cached data to prevent TypeError
- Added afternic.com to benign domains with path checks and included "malicious" in suspicious patterns
- Fixed "Leave Site" button in popup.js to redirect to a safe page instead of just closing
- Added reporting functionality: clicking report marks site as suspicious, adds to reported sites storage
- Added unreport button for reported sites, removes from reported list
- Modified checkUrl to flag reported sites as threats
- Added "Mark as Safe" button for threats, adds to safe sites list and removes from reported
- Modified checkUrl to skip checking safe sites marked by user

## Next Steps
- Test the extension to verify benign data loads from cache on subsequent runs
- Verify that known benign sites are correctly identified without API calls
- Check console logs no longer show force loading messages
- Verify that suspicious parked domains on afternic.com are flagged
- Verify that "Leave Site" button redirects to a safe page
- Verify that reporting a site marks it as suspicious and shows unreport button
- Verify that unreporting removes the threat status
- Verify that marking a threat as safe removes the threat flag and adds to safe list
- If backend.js is used, apply similar changes

## Notes
- API endpoint remains null, so benign data loads from local `benign.json`
- Caching implemented with 24-hour expiry
- Google Safe Browsing API key is configured for threat checking
- Added checks for cached data validity to prevent errors
- Fixed false positive for afternic.com parked pages with malicious domain names
- "Leave Site" now redirects to google.com for safety
- Reported sites and safe sites are stored in chrome.storage.local and checked in checkUrl
