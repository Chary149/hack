# TODO: Resolve Force Loading Benign Data and Block Redirects

## Completed Changes
- [x] Modified `loadBenignData()` in `background.js` to check cache first before loading fallback data
- [x] Added caching of benign data after loading from `benign.json`
- [x] Updated `isBenign()` to check known benign data before calling Google Safe Browsing API
- [x] Changed console logs to remove "Force loading" and "No API endpoint configured" messages
- [x] Added synchronous blocking of known phishing sites in `onBeforeNavigate` to block redirects to unsecure websites
- [x] Added loaded flag to ensure database is loaded before navigation checks
- [x] Fixed TypeError in onBeforeNavigate listener by checking if transitionType exists before calling includes()
- [x] Enhanced redirect blocking by performing full URL check on redirects to catch unwanted website redirects
- [x] Added blocking of redirects to unsecure HTTP websites
- [x] Implemented redirect detection with navigation chain tracking
- [x] Added file type analysis for download protection
- [x] Integrated domain reputation checking for downloads
- [x] Added user preferences whitelist for trusted sites
- [x] Implemented quarantine option with download blocking and notifications
- [x] Added logging for blocked downloads

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the extension to verify benign data loads from cache on subsequent runs
- [ ] Verify that known benign sites are correctly identified without API calls
- [ ] Check console logs no longer show force loading messages
- [ ] Verify that redirects to known phishing sites are blocked
- [ ] Verify no more TypeError in event handler

## Notes
- API endpoint remains null, so benign data loads from local `benign.json`
- Caching implemented with 24-hour expiry
- Google Safe Browsing API key is configured for threat checking
- Synchronous blocking implemented for known threats to handle redirects
- Fixed undefined transitionType issue in navigation listener
